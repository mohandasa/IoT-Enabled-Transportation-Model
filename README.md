# IoT-Enabled-Transportation-Model
Building an IoT enabled connect between various Transportation models using sensor classes.

Project Work Flow:- 

Registration
System Admin creates a Network and adds required Enterprises(bus/train/car) under the network
System Admin also creates Enterprise Admins and their corresponding user accounts
Each Enterprise Admin further creates user accounts for respective enterprise employees (admins and drivers)
Passengers register themselves to the system using the Sign Up option in the app.


Bus Transportation:-
Bus Admin creates the bus and its schedule along with the journey fare and available seats.
Bus Driver selects a bus from the available list and assigns bus for duty 
Passenger selects a bus on which seats are available and books a seat for the journey
Bus Driver can send periodic notifications to the Passengers
Passengers can login to the system and view such notifications


Car Transportation:-
Car Driver adds a list of cars to the system. The information also includes car start and drop points along with the journey fare.
Passenger selects a suitable car from the list and books the car for the journey.
Car Driver can send periodic notifications to the Passengers
Passengers can login to the system and view such notifications


Train Transportation:-
Train Admin creates a train schedule including source and destination along with the fare and available seats
Passenger selects a train on which seats are available and books a seat for the journey
Train Driver can send periodic notifications to the Passengers
Passengers can login to the system and view such notifications



IOT Features:-

Sensor Feature(Car Transportation)
The sensor would act like it’s placed on the car and it gives the car driver information about the speed, fuel, tyre pressure and temperature.
The car driver can view the information and accordingly control his activities.
